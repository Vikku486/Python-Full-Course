"""
üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Python is a general-purpose computer programming language based on object-oriented programming. The programs in Python can run equally on every 
operating system. It is the primary language used in modern technologies like AI, data science, and ML. It was developed in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.

‚≠ê Is Python code compiled or interpreted?
Python code is interpreted. A Python code is converted into bytecode that is executed by a virtual machine in Python. A Python program is not needed 
to build like code for other languages where it is compiled, and it works on an interpreter only.

‚≠ê What is an Interpreted language?
When the implementation of the programs is done directly without compilation of the program into machine language, the language is called interpreted 
language. These languages are slower than the compiled languages. All the debugging occurs at run time in this language. Python, JavaScript, Perl, etc., 
are some of the examples of interpreted languages.

üëâ Python is a case-sensitive language.
